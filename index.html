            <h2>Songbirds as Potential Pollinators</h2>
            <p>Every spring, in a flurry of upheaval,
                millions of songbirds leave their wintering grounds 
                and migrate north to their breeding range. These birds 
                provide a variety of benefits to nature and people such 
                as pest control, seed dispersal, aesthetic beauty, and 
                recreational opportunities. Another service that these 
                birds may provide is pollination; but the nature and 
                frequency of pollination by North American migrants 
                across migratory pathways has not been systematically 
                investigated. Though many songbirds may flower forage and
                provide pollination services as a result; tanagers (genus Piranga),
                new world orioles (genus Icterus), and wood-warblers 
                (family Parulidae) have frequently been observed and described 
                in literature foraging in flowers and hummingbird feeders across 
                North America.</p>
            <p><u>By collaborating with bird banders across western 
                North America, we will use genetic methods to understand
                the role of songbirds in pollen movement.</u></p>

            <img src="/assets/Screenshot 2022-08-14 at 16-45-30 Decline of the North American avifauna.webp">
            <p>In the Americas, migratory songbirds such as Orange-crowned Warblers 
                and Bullock’s Orioles, that are not typically considered nectarivorous, 
                have been observed drinking from nectar feeders or foraging in flowers, 
                including members of the agriculturally important plum (Prunus) genus 
                and maple (Acer) genus often used in landscaping. Members of these plant
                taxa are also forage for bee species, indicating that songbirds may play
                an important role in maintaining genetic connectivity given widespread 
                bee declines in North America. Songbirds may move pollen across extensive
                distances during migration, thus providing a significant pollination service
                for plant populations across patchy landscapes.</p>
            <p>However, across the United States and beyond, songbirds are experiencing 
                extensive population declines. More than 90% of the total loss of 
                avifauna in North America can be attributed to twelve bird families, 
                two of which (Parulidae and Icteridae) constitute two of the primary 
                taxa of interest for this study. Thus, understanding the potential role 
                of songbirds as pollinators is critical for sustaining this ecological 
                process and informing bird conservation practice and policy.</p>

                process samples for flowering plant DNA, and answer exciting questions.</p>
